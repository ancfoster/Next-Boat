## Initial Research

### Competitor & industry analysis

### Survey

A survey was carried out using Google Forms. Participants were found using Facebook and Reddit groups relating to boats and yachts. 

Participants were asked 7 questions and there were 37 participants in total.

The raw results of the survey can be found on a [Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HDTTMKojeGpVuaw_3ELB6GPczg-yYCmi-gI_pNODz5M/edit?usp=sharing).

#### Survey Findings

- From the survey data I produced a treemap graph. This graph visually shows the website features respondents wanted, along with how many people wanted this feature.

- The number one request feature was to have good filtering. Good sorting was also requested but was less important. Being able to remove irrelevant listings is the most important user need.
- The second key finding was that users wanted listing pictures: lots of them, good quality ones and the ability to zoom in on them. This means the website must include a great image experience.
- The third most requested feature was to have detailed listings. This makes sense as for many a boat purchase will be the most expensive after their home. Having as much detail as possible will make it easier for potential buyers to make a decision. Detailed listings might also therefore improve the sale time for sellers. This could be achieved my implementing a minimum amount of detail for a boat to be listed on the site.
- The fourth most common feature/quality request was for the site to be easy to use. This will be a key testing criteria during the site design and development process.

### User Testing of competitor websites

Following the survey, two people volunteered to participate in a user testing of competitor websites. The users were given tasks to carry out on these websites and narrate their thoughts as they completed the tasks. They also gave a summary of positives and negatives at the end.
